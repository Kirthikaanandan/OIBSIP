# Unemployment Analysis with Python | Data Science Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment trends in India using real-world data.
The analysis focuses on understanding unemployment rates, labor participation, and regional
differences across states over time using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project are stored inside the `datasets` folder.

- `Unemployment in India.csv`
- `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`

## Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded datasets using Pandas
- Inspected structure, shape, and column details

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format
- Sorted data based on time
- Removed unnecessary inconsistencies in column names

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed unemployment rate distribution
- Examined labor participation trends
- Performed region-wise unemployment comparison

### 4. Data Visualization
- Line plots to observe unemployment trends over time
- Bar charts to compare unemployment rates across regions
- Box plots to understand distribution and outliers

### 5. Regional Analysis
- Identified states with high and low unemployment rates
- Compared urban and rural employment patterns

## Key Insights
- Unemployment rates increased significantly during the Covid-19 period
- Certain regions consistently experienced higher unemployment
- Clear regional disparities in employment trends were observed
- Labor participation varied notably across states

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze large socio-economic datasets
effectively. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, meaningful insights were
derived about unemployment trends in India. The project helped strengthen skills in
data analysis, visualization, and real-world problem understanding.
