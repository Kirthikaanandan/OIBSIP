# Spam Email Detection | Machine Learning Project

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify emails as Spam or Not Spam using text data.

## Dataset
- File: spam.csv
- Location: datasets folder
- Contains labeled email messages for supervised learning

## Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and explored its structure.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Converted text data into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Prepared features and target variable

### 3. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a classification model for spam detection

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated accuracy on test data
- Tested the model with custom email inputs

## Result
The model successfully classifies emails into Spam and Not Spam categories.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
