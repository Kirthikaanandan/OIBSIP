# Car Price Prediction | Data Science Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored inside the `datasets` folder.

- File name: `car data.csv`
- Source: Provided as part of the internship task

## Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and explored its structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Removed unnecessary columns

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed relationships between price and other features
- Visualized distributions using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### 4. Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Applied regression models to predict car prices

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics
- Compared actual vs predicted prices

## Insights
- Car price decreases as the number of years increases
- Fuel type and transmission have a significant impact on price
- Cars with lower driven kilometers generally have higher resale value

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be used to predict car prices effectively. It helped improve my understanding of regression techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
